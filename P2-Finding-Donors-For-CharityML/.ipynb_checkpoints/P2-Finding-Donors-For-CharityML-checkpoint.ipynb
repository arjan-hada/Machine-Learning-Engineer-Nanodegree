    "In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms of our choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",

    "** Recall (sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score (we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "<br>\n",
    "Even though the ranking of features from the Tree Induction model differs from the Logistic Regression Model (discussed in Question 6), the five most important features are the same. Logically thinking, the increase in age, education, capital gain, hours worked per week, and stable marital status correlates well with the increase in income. These features would make someone more likely to earn higher. Together these features provide a cumulative weight of ~0.7 in the Decision Tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand differences in feature ranking, we need to understand the way Decision Tree, Feature Importance plot in tree induction and Logistic Regression works. Decision Tree model uses recursive divide and conquers approach where the goal at each step is to select a feature that can split the current group into subgroups that are as homogeneous as possible wrt the target variable (maximize information gain). Except for the root node, features are not evaluated in the entire set of instances. The ranking in feature importance plot may not exactly correspond to the order in which features are chosen for the tree model. That is because the feature importance plot ranks each feature by the amount of information gain it gives individually against the entire population of instances. Logistic Regression is a parametric model where we find the set of parameters that maximize the fit of the mathematical equation to the data while retaining the simplicity of the model <sup>[2]</sup>."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model we found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "* Yes, if the training time was a factor, I would consider using the reduced data as the training set. Models are better if they capture the fit to the data better, but they are also better if they are simpler. Adding more features increases the complexity of the model and the complex models are more prone to overfitting. The well-known principle Occam’s razor states “All else being equal, simpler models should be favored over more complex ones.” In addition, we only have a point estimate of performance score on one test set. We don't know the variance of the performance score. The reduction in performance score could be well within the variance. We can get statistics on performance score by using a techinque like k-fold cross validation."
